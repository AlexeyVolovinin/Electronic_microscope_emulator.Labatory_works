var accvolt_info = "<b>Accelerating Voltage:</b><br><br>This controls the energy of the electron beam. A low kV gives a weak electron beam that causes only a few electrons to come off the sample. It is therefore not very bright. But, because it doesn’t penetrate far into the sample, it gives very good surface detail and causes less damage to the sample. A high kV generates lots of electrons and therefore, a nice bright image. However, this can reduce resolution because the beam penetrates deeper into the sample causing electrons to bounce back from a larger region. High kV is therefore best kept for use at low magnifications. <br><img src='https://myscope.training/images/SEM-module/figure_34.svg'><br>Samples like wood and pollen are insulating (even if they have a conductive coating). Such samples are best analysed using a lower accelerating voltage (i.e. 5–10 KeV). Samples that are conductive, can be imaged across a broader range of accelerating voltages as they do not charge.";
var spotz_info = "<b>Spot Size:</b><br><br>Spot size is the diameter of the electron beam at the surface of the sample. It affects both the resolution and the number of electrons that come off the sample. It therefore affects the graininess and brightness of the image. At low magnifications we generally use a larger spot size to get a bright image that is not grainy. At high magnifications we use a small spot size, to get the sharpest, best-defined image. But, we have to compromise by accepting a grainier image. A condensed beam (i.e. small spot size 1–5nm) concentrates electrons across a smaller area, vs. a larger spot size (15–20nm), which spreads the electrons over a larger surface area. A high accelerating voltage (15–20kev) and small spot size (1–5nm) will penetrate deeper into the sample (providing information from deeper in the sample – good for BSE imaging), whilst a large spot size (15–20nm) and low accelerating voltage (5–10KeV) provides more information about the surface (from secondary electrons).";
var zpos_info = "<b>Working distance:</b><br><br>This is the distance between the sample and the end of the SEM column. A large working distance gives a greater depth of field and is good for deeply structured samples at low magnification. A small working distance means that the sample is close to the end of the column. To get the sharpest image at high magnification, choose a small working distance. The trade-off is that a lot of the image will be out of focus. So, when possible, the WD is kept at 10mm or smaller for high-resolution imaging. It is also essential that you take great care not to crash the sample into the end of the column i.e. do not select a working distance of 0mm!";

The coarse focus makes big changes in focus and the fine focus is used for making subsequent small adjustments. In practice, getting good focus is linked to correcting for astigmatism. How out of focus and how badly a-stigmatic an image is, can vary significantly and will dictate how many times you focus and correct the astigmatism. If you can’t get the image in sharp focus with just the focus controls, you will need to adjust the stigmators. The best focus is achieved when the diameter of the electron beam is at a minimum at the surface of the sample. By the end of the process the image should be sharp and well defined.";
